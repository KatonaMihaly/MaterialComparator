# MaterialComparator

This repository is for a web application with one can compare
the material properties of materials from FEMM materials library.
The final project for Software development tools and methods
course at CUBIX.

In this project I demonstrated the following skills:

✅ Python Backend Development: Designed and implemented a Flask-based web application using Python 3.9, showcasing structured, clean, object-oriented programming principles.

✅ Object-Oriented Design: Applied Factory and Strategy design patterns, ensuring flexible, maintainable, and extendable code architecture.

✅ CI/CD Pipeline Integration: Configured TeamCity to automate lint checks, unit tests, and Docker builds, ensuring continuous integration and delivery aligned with best practices.

✅ Containerization with Docker: Dockerized the application for reliable local and cloud deployment, demonstrating DevOps pipeline readiness.

✅ Cloud Deployment: Deployed the containerized application to Google Cloud Run, enabling scalable, serverless operation with automated updates from the main GitHub branch.

✅ Frontend Integration: Created responsive HTML interfaces (index.html, comparison.html) connected with Flask routes to enable user-driven material property comparisons.

✅ Version Control & Release Management: Managed source code with Git and GitHub, using Poetry and pyproject.toml for structured dependency management and reproducible builds.

✅ Testing & Code Quality: Wrote comprehensive unit tests using unittest, applied linter checks (pylint, flake8, bandit) for code quality, and utilized automated testing in CI.

✅ Documentation & Project Management: Managed the project lifecycle using JIRA (Kanban, timelines, epics) and Confluence for documentation, demonstrating effective planning and execution.

✅ UML Design: Created UML diagrams (class and use-case) to communicate architecture and workflows clearly for documentation and stakeholder visibility.

✅ Agile Workflow & Time Management: Successfully scoped, planned, and completed the project in a three-day sprint, demonstrating strong time management and agile development skills.

✅ AI-Assisted Development: Leveraged ChatGPT and JetBrains AI Assistant for task support, enhancing productivity and workflow optimization.

✅ Linux Familiarity: Utilized Linux environments for Docker containerization and testing pipelines, demonstrating OS versatility in development and deployment.
